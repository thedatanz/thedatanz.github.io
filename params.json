As users of data, it is incumbent on us to lead by example and demonstrate good practice.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\nOn the supply side, we will work with government agencies to help them open up data for the good of all. This means sharing resources that help agencies up-skill and close the resourcing gap between \"we made some data\" and \"you can have it\".\r\n\r\nOn the demand side, we will build tools for a wide variety of use cases and software. Data cannot answer your tough questions if you need unfamiliar tools to get it.\r\n\r\n### Who?\r\nStarted by @shaunmcgirr, ready for you to join.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nCheck out our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thedatanz)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
